        "It aggregates votes from decision trees trained on past symptom-disease patterns.",
        "It matches symptoms directly to a fixed disease dictionary.",
        "It prioritizes the first matching disease alphabetically.",

    {
      "question": "Why might Michael's symptoms lead the model to favor Chicken Pox over Hepatitis C?",
      "options": [
        "Because Hepatitis C has fewer symptoms in the training data.",
        "Because skin-related symptoms always are always chosen over internal disease predictions.",
        "Because Chicken Pox symptoms like red spots and skin rash are more distinctively matched by decision trees.",

      "question": "If Michael had reported no rash but more tiredness and yellowing of the skin, what would the system most likely do?",
      "options": [
        "It would still guess Chicken Pox because it remembered earlier symptoms.",
        "It would focus more on liver problems like Hepatitis C.",
        "It would think it's a skin issue like Acne because of past signs.",

        "It uses probabilities from disease predictions to rank relevant specialists.",

        "Because the system avoids general doctors for vomiting-related symptoms.",
        "Because she was matched based on past visits to a specialist.",

        "It flags them for manual review.",

        "Because her symptoms match brain issues more closely in the training data.",

        "Because heart doctors(Cardiologists) aren't included in the system's optiona.",
