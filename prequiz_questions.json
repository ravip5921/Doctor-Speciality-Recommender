        "It matches symptoms directly to a fixed disease dictionary.",

    {
      "question": "Why might Michael's symptoms lead the model to favor Chicken Pox over Hepatitis C?",
      "options": [
        "Because Chicken Pox symptoms like red spots and skin rash are more distinctively matched by decision trees.",
        "Because Hepatitis C has fewer symptoms in the training data.",
        "Because skin-related symptoms always override internal disease predictions.",

        "It uses weighted probabilities from disease predictions to rank relevant specialists.",
        "It assigns a specialist at random based on current symptoms.",

        "Because general physicians are deprioritized for vomiting cases.",

        "Because visual symptoms automatically imply a brain issue.",
