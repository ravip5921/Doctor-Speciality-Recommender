    {
      "question": "Why might Michael's symptoms lead the model to favor Chicken Pox over Hepatitis C?",
      "options": [
        "Because Chicken Pox symptoms like red spots and skin rash are more distinctively matched by decision trees.",

      "question": "Why might Jane be recommended a gastroenterologist instead of a general physician?",
      "options": [
        "Because her symptoms suggest digestive issues, which the system picks up.",
