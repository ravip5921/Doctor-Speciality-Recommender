      "options": [
        "Because his skin symptoms strongly matched Chicken Pox in the model's patterns, which then led to recommending a skin-focused doctor.",

        "Because her symptoms matched digestive problems like Gastroenteritis, which naturally linked to a stomach specialist in the second model.",

      "options": [
        "Because her symptoms like dizziness and slurred speech are strongly linked to neurological issues in the model's training, and the model then recommended a neurologist.",
